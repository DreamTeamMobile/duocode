# DuoCode - Real-Time Collaborative Coding Interview Platform

> DuoCode is a free, privacy-focused collaborative coding interview platform that enables real-time code editing, diagram drawing, and messaging between participants.

## Overview

DuoCode helps interviewers and candidates collaborate during technical interviews. All communication happens peer-to-peer using WebRTC, meaning no data is stored on servers.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Code Editor**: Syntax highlighting for 15+ programming languages (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, Rust, C++, and more)
- **Diagram Canvas**: Drawing tools, shapes (rectangles, circles, lines), text, zoom/pan, undo/redo
- **Messaging**: Built-in chat for communication during sessions
- **P2P Sync**: WebRTC-based synchronization - all data stays between participants
- **No Signup**: Start a session instantly, share the URL, collaborate
- **Privacy**: No server-side storage - sessions are ephemeral
- **PDF Export**: Save session content as PDF
- **Multi-participant**: Support for up to 50 users per session

## How It Works

1. Visit the app
2. Enter your name to create a session
3. Share the session URL with others
4. Collaborate in real-time on code, diagrams, and chat

## Technical Details

- Frontend: TypeScript + React + Vite with Zustand state management
- Sync: WebRTC DataChannel for peer-to-peer communication
- Signaling: Socket.IO for WebRTC connection setup only
- Persistence: Client-side only (localStorage, IndexedDB)

## Use Cases

- Technical coding interviews
- Pair programming sessions
- Algorithm design discussions
- System design whiteboarding
- Code reviews
- Teaching and tutoring
